  <summary markdown="span">3. Python SDK Onboarding Exercise</summary>
  
Once you have finished the Dataloop Python SDK Basic Onboarding, you are ready for a more advanced exercise. We recommend you go through this exercise, after you do the Basic Onboarding, since it will teach you how to use our Python SDK to finish an interesting and fun project in the area of image classification. You will learn everything you need to know around this area, from the basics, such as uploading your data into the Dataset, Annotating the Data using FaaS functions, performing auto-annotation, and managing your deep learning model in Dataloop. [You can find the Onboarding Exercise here.](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/dtlpy-documentation/blob/main/onboarding/11_onboarding_exercise.md)
